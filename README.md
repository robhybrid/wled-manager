# WLED Manager

Application for managing [WLED](https://kno.wled.ge/) devices.

## ðŸ›« Quick Setup

[![Required Node.JS >= 14.18.0 || >=16.0.0](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=node&message=14.18.0%20||%20%3E=16.0.0&logo=node.js&color=3f893e)](https://nodejs.org/about/releases)

- I'm using pnpm, but npm should work fine.

```sh
# clone the project
git clone https://github.com/robhybrid/wled-manager.git

# enter the project directory
cd wled-manager

# install dependency
pnpm install

# develop
pnpm dev
```
